I'm Rodrigo, a data enthusiast. My career began as a manager of a gastronomic establishment, where I developed leadership skills, personnel management, and administration.
Over the years, my interest in data analysis grew, and I began to self-educate in this area within the company. After acquiring knowledge and experience, I decided to validate my path by taking Data Analyst and Data Scientist courses on the Coder House platform.
Today, I am still growing in the world of data, seeking new opportunities to continue learning and growing professionally.
